# LFP_rat_signal_analysis

In gamma_band_entrainment notebook I analyzed local field potential (LFP) data from rat brains, using Phase Lag Index (PLI) and Phase 
Locking Value (PLV) to measure coherence between brain regions such as the hippocampus, 
medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and ventral striatum. Results showed stronger gamma-band 
coherence between the mPFC and hippocampus. 

In another notebook, olfactory_trials_analysis, I analyzed LFP signals from an 
anesthetized rat during an olfactory task. After extracting event-related potentials (ERP) to reduce 
noise, I used phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) technique to measure coupling between theta and 
gamma band signals over time. This method, based on the hypothesis that low-frequency 
oscillations (theta) related to the dendritic input trigger high-frequency spikes (gamma), offered a 
directed measure of coupling and functional connectivity. I demonstrated how inter-region PAC 
changes after an odor stimulus. This work helped me to strengthen my skills in signal processing 
and neuroscientific data analysis.
